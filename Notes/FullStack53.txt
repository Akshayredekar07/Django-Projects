View meant for business logic
Templates meants for the presentation logic

1. Define URL patterns at the application level for better organization and maintainability.

2.Create a new Django app and define URL patterns in the urls.py file.

3.Define corresponding views in the views.py file.

4.Include the new app's URL patterns in the project's urls.py file.

5.Reuse the app inside another application by including its URL patterns in the new application's urls.py file.

6.It is highly recommended to define URL patterns inside the application level for better code structure and reusability.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
django-admin startproject baseproject

cd baseproject

python manage.py startapp testapp 

Create the urls.py file in the testapp application and define URL patterns

inlcue the urls of application level to projevt level urls
    from django.urls import path , include 
    from testapp import urls  

project level urls:::::
from django.urls import path , include 
from testapp import urls  
# this is importtant #canyou inculde all urls of testaapp urls
# not recommended tp define it it the project level
urlpatterns = [
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
    path('testapp/', include('testapp.urls')),
]

    >>Project level urls.py : Identify the corresponding urls.py file in the testapp application 

    >>Application level urls : It will idnetify view function and execute that view function, provide required response 

    name not need to the urls.py but recommed to use the urls.py for better redability

:::::::::::
1. start the project
2. create app application 
3. add application in the setttings.py 
4. define the views functinos insdie the view.py
5.create the urls.py file inside the application and define all required urls for our view functions 

application level:~~~~~~~~~
from django.urls import path 
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path("first/", views.first_view),
    path("sec/", views.second_view),
    path("third/", views.third_view),
    path("four/", views.four_view),
    path("fifth/", views.fifith_view),
]
