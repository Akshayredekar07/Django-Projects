Working with the advanced template features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Template inheritance
2. Template Filters


Template inheritance::
    If mutiple template files have some common code, it is not recommended to write that common code in every template file.
    It increases length of the code and reduces the redability and it increases the devlopment time 

    we have to seperate that common code into a new file, which also known as base template. temaining template files should required to extend base template to that common code will inheritend automatically

base.html:
---------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    {% block title_block %
        <title>Document</title>
    {% endblock%}

</head>
<body>
    {% block body_block %}
        //Anything outside of this block is avilabe to child template.
    This block should be filled by child template to write its own specific code
    {% endblock %}
</body>
</html>

Note:
1. In the prent template, we can define any number of blocks. But child template is responsible to implemnt these blocks

2. It it not mandatory to implement every parent block in child . based on the requirement, child template can decide which block are required to implement

3. while implementing the blocks in the child template, it is not required to follow order.

4. child template can extend any number of parent template.i.e is allowed multiple inheritance

Advantages of template inheritance:

a. Whatever code is avialve in the base template is bydefault avialve to child templates and we are not required to write again. hence promotes code redability
b. It povide unique and same look and feel for the total web application
