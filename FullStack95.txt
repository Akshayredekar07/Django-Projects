Class Based views:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FBV's veiws are olr intorduced in django 1.3V 
CBV's are very very easy to use compared with FBV 

The most commonly used in real time of views CBV

FBV are more poweful with compared to the CBVs 
If you enable to handle the CBV then use FBV 

CBV menats for common requirements:
eg;

Read data from employee table

Complex operation over Employee and customers table simultanoulsy us FBV 

KFC:

very small requirements requre very small pices 

Every CBV internally converted into the FBV 

CBV is wrapper over the FBV  to reduce complexity 

 

 Radymade Shirts;
    
    Clothes --> Tailor --> stich based on his customized requirements 


Everything we can do by FBV then why we should go for CBV?

django-admin startproject CBVProject

Hello world application using the CBV views:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
from django.views.generic import View
from django.http import HttpResponse

# Create your views here.
class HelloWorldView(View):
    def get(self, request):
        return HttpResponse("<h1>Hello Hitman #45❤️ </h1>")



``````````````````````````````````````````

Note: 
    ?? While defining class based views as we have extends View class 

    2. To provide response to GET request, django will always call get() method. hence we have to override this method in our view class. similarly other http methods lke POST(), head(), put(), delete(), etc

    3. While defining url patterns we have to use as_view() method 

    Template based application using class based views~~~~~~~~
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from testapp import views
urlpatterns = [
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
    path("hello/", views.HelloWorldView.as_view()),
    path("tt/", views.TemplateCBV.as_view()),
]

from django.views.generic import View
from django.views.generic import TemplateView
from django.http import HttpResponse


# Create your views here.
class HelloWorldView(View):
    def get(self, request):
        return HttpResponse("<h1>Hello Hitman #45❤️ </h1>")


class TemplateCBV(TemplateView):
    template_name='testapp/result.html'
