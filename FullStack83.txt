The client and server communicate with the sme common language which is nothing but http

The basic limitation of http is it is stateless protocol. i.e it is unable to remember to 
the client information for the future purpose across multiple requests. Every request to 
the server is treated as the new only 


To remeber client information at server side, some special machanism must be required wich is nothing but Session management mechanism

Following are the some Session management mechanism:

1. Cookies
2. Session API 
3. URL Rewriting 
4. hidden form fields

    >> request.COOKIES.get(cname)
    >> request.COOKIES.get(cname, defaultvalue)
