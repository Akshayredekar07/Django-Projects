Working with the advanced model concept:

Model Inheritance;

It is very useful method and powerful feature in django:
5 types of model Inheritance in django:

1. Abstract base class model inheritance
2. multitable inheritance 
3. Multilevel inheritance
4. Multiple inheritacne
5. Proxy model inheritacne

1. Abstract based class model inheritance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

class Student(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=64)
    email = models.EmailField()
    address = models.CharField(max_length=64)
    subject = models.CharField(max_length=64)
    salary = models.FloatField()

class Teacher(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=64)
    email = models.EmailField()
    address = models.CharField(max_length=64)
    subject = models.CharField(max_length=64)
    salary = models.FloatField()    


If several model classes having common fields, then it is not recommended to write these fields in every model class seperately, because it increases length of the code and reduces redability

We have to seperate those common fields into a seperate Model class which is nothing but Base class. If we extend Base class then automatically common fields will be inherited to every Child class 


without Inheritance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


With inheritacne
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

class ContactInfo():
    name = models.CharField(max_length=64)
    email = models.EmailField()
    address = models.CharField(max_length=64)
    class Meta:
    abstract = True


class Student(ContactInfo):
    subject = models.CharField(max_length=64)
    salary = models.FloatField()

class Teacher(ContactInfo):
    subject = models.CharField(max_length=64)
    salary = models.FloatField()    



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~django-admin startproject ModelInProject1~~~~

python manage.py startapp testapp

Note: 
ContactInfo class is an abstarct class and hence table won't be created




2. Multitable inheritacne~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the base class is not abstarct then such tpye of inheritance is called multitable inheritance.

This type of inheritacne is applicable at code level and db level.
In Multitable inheritance, inside database, for both parent and child, table will be created.
